# Calendar

## A calendar app that can tell whether your friend is valid

### Description
When I joined a study group for CPSC 110 last semester, I found it 
difficult to efficiently track when the members of the group were
available. Each person had a different schedule, and I struggled to
find an ideal app for sharing schedules. This is why I decided to 
create this calendar project. 

In this calendar project, users can not only *view*, *modify*, and *delete* 
their own calendars but also search for *shared free time* among other
users and themselves.


### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to load and view my calendar, including the newly added one and previous one.
- As a user, I want to be able to add an myEvent to my calendar, and choose to save it or not.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete an myEvent from my calendar, and choose to remove it from the data or not.
- As a user, I want to be able to check my friend's available time.
