# Jigsaw Puzzle Focus Timer

## A focus application inspired by pomodoro timer

### Description
In my daily studies, I often find it challenging to concentrate
for extended periods on a single task. I have been a Pomodoro
Time user previously, but I found it has the following problems:
- **Lack of a phased reward system**: it is difficult for users to
  stay motivated throughout the process without breaks.
- **Short time intervals**: 25-minute interval is too short and may
  not suit the needs for users who require longer periods of
  concentrated focus.

In this application, users will complete a *jigsaw puzzle*
by dedicating **90 minutes** of focused time. Every 10 minutes,
a piece of the puzzle will automatically appear on the screen
until the entire puzzle is completed at the end of 90 minutes.
I hope this application can assist individuals who wish to
concentrate on their tasks with a fixed time frame without
distractions.
